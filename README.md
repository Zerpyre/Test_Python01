Welcome to the Frontier!

Congratulations! You've been chosen as a lead technician to troubleshoot and repair the Interstellar
Trade Customs Detection Software (IT-CDS), a crucial system running on Python 3.10, deployed at the 
main checkpoint of Titan, Saturn's largest moon.

With the rise of interplanetary trade and tourism, Titan has become the new hotspot for cosmic 
adventurers, traders, and thrill-seekers from across the galaxy. As the premier lunar destination,
our customs officers rely heavily on IT-CDS to inspect and scan items from visitors to ensure smooth
and secure entry into Titan's dynamic atmosphere.

IT-CDS plays an essential role in analyzing scanned cargo and personal items from interstellar 
travelers. However, the system has recently encountered major malfunctions after an unusual gamma-ray 
burst on October 13, 2038, affecting its ability to process items efficiently.

According to the Titan Space Federation laws, all travelers must carry at least one personal oxygen mask
in their space luggage. Any traveler failing to comply with this requirement should be rejected immediately!

Your mission is to investigate and repair the IT-CDS, which was thrown into disarray after the burst.
The system is designed to analyze the content of traveler's cargo and personal items to determine whether
they are classified as safe for interplanetary trade or if they pose a risk.

To aid you in your task, you have access to two item [safe.txt](storage%2Fsafe.txt) and [dangerous.txt](storage%2Fdangerous.txt)
â€”which categorize 
various goods. Pay special attention to the phrase "Any kind of <item>," which implies that all types 
of such an item are restricted or approved.

For items that don't appear on either list, you'll need to consult the Universe's decision-making engine,
which will provide insight into how to handle such items. Fortunately, the functionality for this is still
working and hasn't been affected by the gamma-ray burst.

Your ultimate goal is to fix and refactor the existing code, ensuring it behaves correctly and efficiently.
There are also a couple of disclaimer notes in the code that you should address while applying best 
practices for optimization and clarity.

Good luck, Technician! The fate of Titan's safe and secure trade depends on your expertise!
